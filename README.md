## Task

Build a command that pulls data from an API and stores it against the User model.

- Call the [https://reqres.in/] API to pull in the first page of users only.

We could potentially use this command in a schedule to repeatedly update the users from the API.

Please don’t view this task as just completing the functional requirements. This is your chance to wow us with what you can do…
